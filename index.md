Hey!

I'm Jan Taverniers, a biology enthusiasts and a _touche-Ã -tout_. You can learn
 more about me and my different projects on this portofolio website.

I am easy to reach so feel free to contact me. I am looking for a job right now
 as lab technician (and later as QA engineer) and I'd like too to dip a toe into
  software development outside of what I am doing for my non-profits now.

Then you should have a look at my profile. It is quite atypical. I am sure you
will find some interesting things in there!

I am a coffee enthusiast, if one day you'd like to discuss with me, we can take
a good coffee together.

  Philosophy
</h4>

I love working with people, coming from a non-profit background I have to do my
best to balance the best interest for my co-workers (often volunteers), bring an
enjoyable atmosphere and getting things done.

It is not an easy task, but it is a greateful one when everything works out! And
so far it all did work out!
