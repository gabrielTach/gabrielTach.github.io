  What Keeps me Busy
</h4>
I am a Junior System Engineer at [AG Solution](https://agsolutiongroup.com) in Antwerpen, Belgium.

And I run two non-profits, [Flüüfff](https://fluufff.org) that organises a convention a year and [Ouftimeet](https://Ouftimeet.com) that regularly plans friendly meets.

Don't forget to take a peak at my [Curriculum]({% link curriculum.html %}). It is quite atypical. I am sure you
will find some interesting things in there!

  My Philosophy
</h4>

I love working with people. Coming from a [non-profit]({% link projects.html %}#flüüfff) background I have to do my
best to balance the best interest for my co-workers (often volunteers), bring an
enjoyable atmosphere and getting things done.

It is not an easy task, but it is a greateful one when everything works out! And
so far it all did work out!

I am also curious and I want to keep learning new things and keep on improving
my current knowledge.

I am currently learning Ruby on Rails (mastering), C#, diving deeper into Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
