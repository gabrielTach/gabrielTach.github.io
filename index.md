  Hey there!
</h4>

I'm Jan Taverniers, a biology enthusiasts and a _touche-à-tout_. You can learn
 more about me and my [different projects]({% link projects.html %}) on this portofolio website.

I am easy to reach so feel free to contact me. I am looking for a job right now
as lab technician (and later as QA engineer) and I'd like to dip a toe into
software development outside of what I am doing for my non-profits now.

  Are you a Headhunter?
</h4>

Then you should have a look at my profile. It is quite atypical. I am sure you
will find some interesting things in there!

I am currently looking for a job as __lab technician in a Quality lab__
(Biology/Biotechnology/Pharmaceutic) and as __DevOps if I can get a training
first__.

Don't forget to take a peak at my [Curriculum]({% link curriculum.html %}).

  Let's Have A Drink
</h4>

I am a coffee enthusiast, if one day you'd like to discuss with me, we can Have
a drink together. [Let me know]({% link contact.html %}).

Not a fan of the black juice? No problem, suit yourself!

  My Philosophy
</h4>

I love working with people. Coming from a [non-profit]({% link projects.html %}#flüüfff) background I have to do my
best to balance the best interest for my co-workers (often volunteers), bring an
enjoyable atmosphere and getting things done.

It is not an easy task, but it is a greateful one when everything works out! And
so far it all did work out!

I am also curious and I want to keep learning new things and keep on improving
my current knowledge.

I am currently learning on mastering Ruby on Rails and learning how to code in
Kotlin (and later how to make Android Apps).
