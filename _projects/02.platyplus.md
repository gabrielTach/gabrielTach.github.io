Platyplus is a registration system for conventions developped in PHP. It is very configurable and is thus used by more than one convention.

It has been tested and validated in real life and keeps being improved after each edition of a convention. Flüüfff and Fauntastic are part of its users.

I have mainly worked on the back-end of the system and the documentation.

It accepts different payment providers and the plan is to make it work with even more providers.
