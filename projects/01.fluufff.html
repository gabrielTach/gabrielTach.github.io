<p>Flüüfff is a residential convention in Belgium and the first Non-Profit I have founded. I have been very invested in that project and I have taken different roles in there, and still am holding some: administrator, Web/IT team leader and main dev, convention safety and security.</p>

<p>The design was made by <a href="https://www.inekedebo.be/latestWork">Inkeke</a>, the front-end by <a href="https://twitter.com/HypiTheFox">Hypi</a>, I worked on the back-end.</p>

<p>It has been quite a challenged as I had to develop multiple skills I didn’t had before, or didn’t used as thoroughly as I do now. Meetings, trainings, organization and administration are now skills I have no trouble using at all!</p>

<p>2020 has been very hard, but I used my skills and knowledge in public health, epidemiology and virology to provide guidelines and recommendations for the Board of Administrators. I shared my work too with similar events to help them to prepare and take similar decisions.</p>
