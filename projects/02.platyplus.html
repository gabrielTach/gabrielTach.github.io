<p>Platyplus is a registration system for conventions developped in PHP. It is very configurable and is thus used by more than one convention.</p>

<p>It has been tested and validated in real life and keeps being improved after each edition of a convention. Flüüfff and Fauntastic are part of its users.</p>

<p>I have mainly worked on the back-end of the system and the documentation.</p>

<p>It accepts different payment providers and the plan is to make it work with even more providers.</p>
