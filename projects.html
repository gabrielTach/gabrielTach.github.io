<p>Flüüfff is a residential convention in Belgium and the first Non-Profit I have founded. I have been very invested in that project and I have taken different roles in there, and still am holding some: administrator, Web/IT team leader and main dev, convention safety and security.</p>

<p>The design was made by <a href="https://www.inekedebo.be/latestWork">Inkeke</a>, the front-end by <a href="https://twitter.com/HypiTheFox">Hypi</a>, I worked on the back-end.</p>

<p>It has been quite a challenged as I had to develop multiple skills I didn’t had before, or didn’t used as thoroughly as I do now. Meetings, trainings, organization and administration are now skills I have no trouble using at all!</p>

<p>2020 has been very hard, but I used my skills and knowledge in public health, epidemiology and virology to provide guidelines and recommendations for the Board of Administrators. I shared my work too with similar events to help them to prepare and take similar decisions.</p>

            <p>Platyplus is a registration system for conventions developped in PHP. It is very configurable and is thus used by more than one convention.</p>

<p>It has been tested and validated in real life and keeps being improved after each edition of a convention. Flüüfff and Fauntastic are part of its users.</p>

<p>I have mainly worked on the back-end of the system and the documentation.</p>

<p>It accepts different payment providers and the plan is to make it work with even more providers.</p>

<p>Fauntastic is a residential convention in Lyon, France. It started in 2019.</p>

<p>I have been in charge of the Website (the design has been made by Hypi) and the Registration online and onsite. Of course I have been using Platy+ there.</p>

<p>Rewar.de is a real live achievements system. Its goal is to gamify the attendency to a convention with achievements, like some games do.</p>

<p>It has mechanisms which allows it to limit cheatingand work in areas with a poor internet connection.</p>

<p>It is developped in Ruby.</p>
